Create a login and register screen with all the gabagoo in the framework behind it

Think about different user logins and authentification i.e.:
	-registered_user is default login
	-teachers can be registered only by an admin
	-admin can be registered only through another admin
	-so do the atelier_managers
	-unregistred users don't have access to any tables, only to the login srceen
#we should go over this and figure out the specifics

GO over the database and work out kinks

Create a separate table for the restricted items and the users they are restricted to
